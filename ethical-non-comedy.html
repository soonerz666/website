      Ethical Non Comedy (ENC) was founded with the aim of creating financially accessible and inclusive
       comedy opportunities for women, LGBTQIA+, and gender non-conforming individuals in Canberra.

      Our core vision was to provide a safe and creative space where 
      adults could explore comedy, embrace silliness, and feel comfortable 
      giving performance and writing a go, regardless of experience level.
      
      <br><br>
      A key motivation was to foster a sense of community among amateur 
      comedians and offer pathways into the performing arts that were casual and affordable.
      
      <br><br>
      ENC began with support from the Good Company grant program, a joint initiative by
      <a href="https://www.youareherecanberra.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You Are Here</a>
      and the ACT Government through the Creative Recovery and Resilience Program. 
      <br><br>
      This initial funding allowed us to run our first event: a free 'Intro to Sketch' workshop at 
      The Front in Lyneham, designed to give participants a taste of sketch comedy and connect with others.

      Building on this, in 2022 we offered 
      two paid 8-week courses at the Ainslie Arts Centre that delved deeper into sketch and improv techniques.
      The second of these courses was specifically supported by the ACT Government's <i>Capital of Equality Grant Program</i>.

      We wrapped everything up with a final performance night at
       <a href="https://ainslieandgorman.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ainslie+Gorman</a>.
      The show, called 'Edging Sketch', was sold out and featured all the sketches developed by ENC members throughout the semester.
