      The Plunge kicked off in 2020 and ran until 2023. 
      The idea was simple: bring casual, affordable arts events to young Canberrans, welcoming both new performers and listeners. 
      We had everyone telling stories â€“ from seasoned comedians to public servants.
      It was all made possible by incredible volunteers and our generous winter host, Highroad in Dickson. 
      We were lucky to host events in backyards across the inner north and at the base of Mount Ainslie, on land with such a deep history of Indigenous storytelling.
